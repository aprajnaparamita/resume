# Resume for Janet Jeffus

After fighting Word for a few hours I decided to do it with Ruby, CSS
and HTML. The project uses Guard, so I could write the code and rely on
LiveReload to update css and html from the Less and Slim.

There are git submodules I used to get the fonts for transfonter. And I
used npm for managing css dependencies.

I converted it from Word's mishmash of tag soup using Nokogiri. Then
hand-tweaked the less until it looked good. Then printed each page using
Firefox and used combine_pdf to generate the final resume.
